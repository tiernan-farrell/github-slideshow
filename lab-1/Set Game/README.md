### Game Play Instructions

Choose your difficulty level and test your skills against player 2, a computer player.



Click on three cards that form a “set.”
A correctly-identified set consists of 3 cards that are all the same or all different in terms of the four features: shape, color, number of items, and shading.

The game is a race between you and the computer player. Who can find the most sets?
You are not taking turns with the computer player; find as many sets as you can.

If there are no sets are on the board, click ok when prompted and the current board will be dealt a fresh set of 12 cards.

There are three levels of difficulty. The level of difficulty that you choose determines how much of a head start the computer will give you before identifying a set and scoring a point.

Each time you correctly identify a set, the computer will wait for a time duration corresponding to the level of difficulty chosen before jumping in and forming a set.

You can click the hint button to reveal up to 2 members of a set. Your job then becomes a matter of correctly identifying the 3rd card in the set before the computer swoops in and forms a set.
